## Case

1. What was the max wave height (hmax) at coordinates (0.000, 0.000) on 2019-01-01?

2. We want to create a simple application to let our customers inspect the max wave height for the
   location of their choice for a given day. To simplify, we will only support 2019-01-01 for now.
3. Create an interactive map where you get the max wave height for the point you click on.
   Anything to make the UI user friendly (e.g loading wheel ++) are not required - and will
   not be taken into account. If there is something you would want to add but is too time
   consuming, you can just add a note about it.
